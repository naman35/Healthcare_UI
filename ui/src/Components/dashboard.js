							<p><strong>TIPS FOR COMPLETION</strong></p>
							<p>
								<strong>OUR STRONG RECOMMENDATIONS AND TIPS FOR YOU
									ABOUT COMPLETING PUSH-D PROGRAM:</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Total duration : </strong>For maximum benefits,
									we recommend that you make all attempts to complete the program
									within 1.5 months of registering for the same. Your
									registration to this site is valid for a period of 3 months
									from the date of completing your registration process.</li>
                                    <br></br>
								<li><strong>Frequency of engaging with the
										program/number of slots per week : </strong>Regularity and continuity
									are critical for deriving benefit of this self-care program.</li>
                                <br></br>
								<li>We suggest you to keep aside at least two slots on two
									different weekdays (Non-consecutive days, e.g. Monday and
									Thursday rather than Monday and Tuesday) for working on this
									program. This way, you are likely to finish the program in
									about one and half to two months.</li>
                                <br></br>
								<li><strong>Your slot is your session : </strong>A slot
									here refers to a continuous time period during which you go
									over the contents of the program and complete the exercises
									contained therein. A slot is similar to a session that people
									might have with a therapist/counsellor in face-to-face
									interactions.</li>
                                <br></br>
								<li><strong>Slot-duration : </strong>As this is a self-care
									program, we recommend you to keep each slot for minimum 20
									minutes and maximum up to 45 minutes.</li>
                                <br></br>
								<li><strong>Time-estimates for various sections :
								</strong>We have provided a rough estimate of the time required to
									complete each section, which may help you to plan as you move
									from one section to the next. <br></br>If you were just
									mechanically/passively reading the content under each of the
									sections, you might just finish it in a very short period of
									time. But, this may not be of much use! <br></br>We would want
									you to take your time to think about what you are reading as
									well as during the interval period between slots when you are
									trying to apply what you read. <br></br>We encourage you to go
									over the content in each section at least one more time after
									you have gone over it once. This is similar to what happens in
									direct face to face sessions with a therapist, wherein a few
									key ideas may be discussed in more than one session so that you
									can consolidate your learning and see its personal relevance. <br></br>The
									time-estimates and the recommended number of sessions provided
									at the start of each section take into account the time needed
									to go over the section more than once.</li>
								<br></br>
								<li><strong>Apply and Practice : </strong>You will derive
									maximum benefit when you try to apply and practice what you
									discover/learn during your sessions. We recommend that you use
									your workbook and complete various exercises and keep a record
									of how you apply in your daily life whatever you learn in the
									program. Workbook  can be  accessed  on the  web-browser  version  of PUSH-D and  is best used on laptop/desktop.</li>
								<br></br>
								<li><strong>Schedule your next slot and receive a
										mobile reminder : </strong>At the end of each slot, you have the
									facility of scheduling your next slot for yourself. A mobile
									prompt will be sent as a reminder to you on the day you have
									scheduled the next slot.</li>
								<br></br>
								<li><strong>E-Assistance: : </strong>We will be
									periodically sending mobile based messages/prompts and /or
									emails to keep you motivated to engage in self-care. You can
									mail us for troubleshooting any difficulty in completing
									PUSH-D/ any new mental health problem/requesting for our
									suggestions regarding seeking face to face professional
									consultation/for seeking an appointment with PUSH-D
									consultants.</li>
								<br></br>
								<li><strong>Connect over email : </strong>You may choose to
									drop us a mail to clarify your doubts regarding the program
									exercises etc. Such e-mails would be responded to within three
									working days.<br></br>Mail id :  push.d.nimhans@gmail.com</li>

								or any other person in any way, it would strongly recommend you

								contact with any trained professional of your choice. If you so

								information regarding the availability of centers/trained mental
								health professional in your region, if such information is

								medical practitioner or qualified mental health practitioner for
